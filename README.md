IDE Used:

	The IDE I used to complete this project was Eclipse Version: Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a).

Version of Java Used:

	I used java version: Java 9 SE.

Current working Directory Used for Game:

	"/csc413-tank-game-ksurban/jar/TankGame/src" is where you can find all java files and classes.

How to Run the Game:

	In the csc413-tank-game-ksurban folder, go in to the jar folder and you will find
	a file "TankGame.jar" open it and the game will run. 

	NOTE: In case the "TankGame.jar" file fails or loads a white screen, you can manually import and build the project in the IDE used.

	To Build, Import, and Run in the IDE used:

		1) Open Eclipse and you will be asked for the directory of your desired workspace

		2) Eclipse will open a workspace and may automatically import the project if it is found in 
		that directory

		3) If the project is not automatically imported, manually import the project by clicking on 
		“File”, then “Import…”. This opens up a small window asking to select the project file or directory. For this case, the directory is "/csc413-tank-game-ksurban/jar/TankGame/"

		4) Select “General” and then “Projects from Folder or Archive”

		5) Navigate to the directory of the project and then click “Finish” at the bottom of the 
		window

		6) After successfully importing the project into your workspace, on the top and on the same row as where you would “File”, go to “Run” and a drop down list will appear

		7) Select “Run Configurations…”. A window titled “Run Configurations” will popup

		8) On the left hand side, you’ll see a list of options (Gradle Project, Java Applet, Java Application, …). Double click “Java Application” and a new configuration titled “New_configuration” will be made for you. 

		9) In the “Main” tab, under Project select your project and then under main class select Search where you will be prompted a list of main classes with a main class. For this project, select “TankRotatationExample - TankGame”

		10) Finally, click apply and then run. The window will close and the project will run.
		Once this configuration is made, you can press the green circle with a white play arrow inside of it if you’d like to run the same configuration again.
